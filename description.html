<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> For our visualization project, we’ve chosen the “Analyzing Citybike Data” topic, because all of us are using the citybike service. In addition we really like the concept of sharing services like cars, bikes and other shareable resources. We &hearts; citybikes. </p>

<h2>
Target application
</h2>

<p>
  In this visualization we’d like to create a webapplication, which provides the user the possibility to understand and analyse the more complex dataset of the citybikeservice. For this purpose we’d like to use a dataset which offers data information about the most frequently used stations, the occupancy of the stations, damage reports, driven routes etc. After checking at <a href="http://www.citybikewien.at">citybikewien.at</a> we managed to find a csv-dataset which holds all stations with its properties. Furthermore we got some datasets from the professors of the course. Our visualization should provide a general overview of the citybike-service and is directed to all of the people, which are interested in citybikes. We created some different solution attemps to visualize a big dataset like this and tried to develop a broad spectrum of possibilities. So there are prototypes, which provide a station-comparisor or approximately draw likely driven routes to visualize connectivity between stations. After the presentation of M2 we'd really would appreciate feedback to our prototypes to define a specific direction of the project. 
 </p>


<h2>
Dataset
</h2>
<div id="imp">
<ul>
  <li>list of the stations</li>
  <li>damage-reports</li>
  <li>station traffic, like: Where did you get that bike, and where did you return it. </li>
  <li>timestamps of the rental-times</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2>
User
</h2>

<p>
  We expect our users to be mainly cyclists, who are interested in citybikes and want to see which and how many stations there are. And which stations to pick or to avoid considering the station’s frequent usage.  But there are even more possible users, like someone who's considering opening a restaurant or a bar. Maybe that person would like to check which station is really busy to find the perfect spot for his pub.

We want to build a modern Application which runs on every platform.  To accomplish this goal, we decided to build a Web Application which supports all modern web-browsers. 

The Web Application will be written in JavaScript. JQuery will be used to keep the application browser independent and to save us from writing code for each separate web browser. The d3 toolkit will be used for creating charts and views. The Google Maps API allows us to create an interactive map where we can draw bicycle routes and provide the user with a familiar interface to work with.

To increase the performance we need to split the datasets in parts and load them when needed. Therefore we're going to use C#.NET and Java.
