<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> For our visualization project, we’ve chosen the “Analyzing Citybike Data” topic, because all of us are using the citybike service. In addition we really like the concept of sharing services like cars, bikes and other shareable resources. We &hearts; citybikes. </p>

<h2>
Target application
</h2>

<p>
  In this visualization we’d like to create a webapplication, which provides the user the possibility to understand and analyse the more complex dataset of the citybikeservice. For this purpose we’d like to use a dataset which offers data information about the most frequently used stations, the occupancy of the stations, damage reports, driven routes etc. After checking at <a href="http://www.citybikewien.at">citybikewien.at</a> we managed to find a csv-dataset which holds all stations with its properties. But we’re still missing a dataset which provides a specific view on the driven routes and damage reports. Thus we're dependent from other ressources we couldn't find yet. On the vda-course-website it is saying that there will be data, so we're quite confident to reach our goals. 
 </p>


<h2>
User
</h2>

<p>
  We expect our users to be mainly cyclists, who are interested in citybikes and want to see which and how many stations there are. And which stations to pick or to avoid considering the station’s frequent usage.  But there are even more possible users, like someone who's considering opening a restaurant or a bar. Maybe that person would like to check which station is really busy to find the perfect spot for his pub.
