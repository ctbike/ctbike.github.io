A very brief reminder of our problem</br>
We are provided with a complex data set of the city bike service. Our challenge is now to observe the data and visualize important questions. The main focus is to prepare the data for the user in a manner where it can be interpreted easily. </br>
(Oder auch) with the citybike app we want to accomplish a visualization of the data which makes it understandable to the citybike customer who is interested in the service and wants to get insight information. This could mean frequency of usage of a certain citybike station or damage reports respectively.  
</p>
<p> 
Main problems </br>
Data set is limiting possibilities </br>
Finding a target user is difficult with given data as there is data which describes merely how customers use the service (which is not so interesting for another customer)</br>
Random Gedanken</br>
Single ansicht:
Detail view.
Wie schnell fährt man zu der anderen station (km/h)
User weiß wenn er von a nach b fährt und durschn. 10km/h dass es viele Hürden gibt, die verlangsamen.

Multi Ansicht:
Nach Bezirke?
Dropdown Bezirke wählen. Die werden hell, andere transparent

<b>Changes to the original VIS design/work plan</b></br>
Because of confusing overlapping of real route drawing, we decided to use point-to-point (air line) drawing. 
We tried to use an inbound circle and an outbound circle for each station to show the difference, but for most stations the in- and outbound rides are distributed equally which lead to more confusion then additional value for the user. So we agreed on using just one circle for the entire rides.
</br>
TODO: Change Usecase to Data Journalism. 
</br>

<b>Progress</b></br>
We wrote a C#.NET tool to map the different dataset together, the tool loops through the files, maps them together and creates a JSON-File for the WebApplication.

The WebApplication includes JavaScript-Files, JavaScript Libraries, CSS Files, Data Files and Configuration Files. 

We have separate JavaScript-Files for the map and the charts. We tried to built the map and the charts as stand-alone modules to keep them exchangeable.  
We are using JavaScript Libraries like jQuery, google maps API, google charts API and d3 to accomplish our different tasks.
Our data files are JSONs and configuration XMLs. The JSONs hold information about stations, amount of rides and other stuff for example locations. The XMLs are used by the WebApplication to load colours and other design information. Our idea was, to change parts of the design just in the XML without changing the code, it's faster and the error-rate keeps lower.

At the moment we've got an interactive map which shows us all the city bike stations. On a station click the lines between stations are drawn. These lines represent the traffic (and amout, 
line thickness) among the stations. The terminals coloured circles illustrate the total amount of traffic at the stations. If the circle is bigger there is more traffic, if the circle is 
smaller there is less traffic. The panel on the right, gives us some developer information about the dataset and will be replaced with the charts. Also it's possible to select more than 
one station, this is important for our comparable charts, which will be added at a later point.

The TreeView mock-up chart uses the damage reports to provide the user with an overview about the damages. The user has the option to choose a district. Each node has a different size which 
represents the amount of damage reports for the specific district. After a district has been selected the user sees nodes for each station in that district. The nodesize represents again 
the amout of damage reports (for stations). Details about the damages are presented after a click on a station. Again, new nodes, this time each node is another (unique) damage, the size 
is the frequency of the specific damage. 

The Bubble-Chart gets the stations-ID from the clickable map, depending on which station is selected. It shows the correlation between incoming and outgoing rides, as well as the entire usage for the chosen stations. It is also possible to see the incoming and outgoing rides for specific months through the slider under the chart. This will also change the x- and y- axis's range. The color of the bubbles are dependent of their districts and the size of the entire usage. If two stations have the same color, then they're in the same district. Also there is a mouseover-effect to see the specific details. 
</br>

<b>Major challenges/problems</b></br>
The (different) datasets were hard to combine. We wrote a tool to map them together.
The damage report dataset doesn't have a unique identifier to map a damage report to a station.
At the moment we're able to get information about the damage reports for all stations but not for a specific one. 
</br>

<b>Questions</b></br>

Relative/absoulte amount for the TreeView?
Proportion Map(Navigation) / DetailView?

TODO: FUTURE!
